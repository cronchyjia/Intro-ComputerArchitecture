# Intro-ComputerArchitecture
This repository showcases concepts taught to me such as CPU, memory, buses, I/O, cache, instruction sets, interrupt processing, pipelining, performance, memory organization, and management (including virtual memory, protection, segmentation and paging). AVR assembly language programming and its interface with a high-level language C.
